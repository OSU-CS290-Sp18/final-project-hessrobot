Welcome to team HessroBot!  What is HessroBot?  Well you see, one day back in data structures, Phillip said "I wonder what Hessro's Steam name is".  LK replied with "Probably HessroBot".  Thus, HessroBot was formed.  Jason took the initative to colaborate with Phillip and LK.  Phillip invited Reese, and then the super team was fully formed.  Here we stand with a repo that just contains a README, License, and .gitignore.  What will you make of it?  

Team Members:
 1. Jason "The founder" O'Brian.  A man of inititive 
 2. Thang "LK" Kim.  Master of basketball
 3. Phillip "The Nerd" Mestas.  Backend Engineer (hopefully)
 4. Reese "The Beast" Benson.  CSS Lord
